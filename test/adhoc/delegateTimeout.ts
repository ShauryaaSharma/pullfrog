"Carefully analyze the following engineering question. Think through each point thoroughly before finishing.

Question: Design a comprehensive error handling strategy for a distributed microservices architecture. Consider:
1. Circuit breaker patterns — when to open, half-open, close. What thresholds to use.
2. Retry policies — exponential backoff with jitter. Maximum retry counts. Which errors are retryable.
3. Dead letter queues — when to use them, how to process failed messages, alerting.
4. Health check endpoints — liveness vs readiness probes, dependency health checks.
5. Graceful degradation — fallback responses, feature flags, bulkhead pattern.

After you have finished your analysis, call gh_pullfrog/set_output with EXACTLY the string 'DELEGATE_TIMEOUT_PASSED' — not your analysis, just that exact string."
