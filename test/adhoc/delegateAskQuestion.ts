STEP 1 — GATHER INFO:
Use gh_pullfrog/ask_question to ask: "What files are in the root directory of this repository? List them."

STEP 2 — DELEGATE WITH CONTEXT:
After receiving the answer, select Plan mode via select_mode, then delegate to a subagent with mini effort.
Your subagent instructions MUST include:
- The list of files you learned about from step 1
- Tell the subagent to call gh_pullfrog/set_output with EXACTLY this format: "FILES_FOUND=true,COUNT=<N>" where <N> is the number of files from the list you gave it
- Do NOT create any branches, commits, or PRs

After delegation completes, call set_output yourself with the subagent's result.

IMPORTANT: You MUST use ask_question BEFORE delegating. The subagent prompt must reference specific files from the ask_question answer.`,
