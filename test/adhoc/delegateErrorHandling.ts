1. Select Plan mode via select_mode.
2. Delegate to a subagent with mini effort. Subagent instructions:
   "Use gh_pullfrog/file_read to read the file 'this-file-does-not-exist-anywhere.xyz'. Report what you find by calling gh_pullfrog/set_output with the file content. If the file cannot be read, call gh_pullfrog/set_output with 'FILE_NOT_FOUND'."
3. After the delegation completes, examine the result. The subagent should have reported FILE_NOT_FOUND or an error.
4. Call set_output with EXACTLY: "ERROR_HANDLED=true,REASON=<brief description of what went wrong>"

If the delegation failed entirely (subagent crashed), still call set_output with "ERROR_HANDLED=true,REASON=delegation_failed".

The point of this test is that you handle the error gracefully and report it — not that you succeed at reading the file.`,
