/**
 * BYOK-no-keys fallback test — proves that an account configured for a
 * BYOK model (here: `moonshotai/kimi-k2`) but with no provider API
 * keys present in the runner env still gets a successful run by falling
 * back to a free OpenCode model.
 *
 * This was the structural failure that took out 15 accounts post-launch
 * before the fallback shipped: GH Actions secret references resolved to
 * empty strings (because the secrets didn't exist), the action launched
 * Claude Code with no key, the LLM provider 401'd, and the run died in
 * 20s with a synthesized "Invalid API key" message.
 *
 * The env block below empty-strings every known provider key — that's
 * exactly what GitHub Actions does when a `${{ secrets.X }}` reference
 * resolves to a missing secret. We verify:
 *   1. the run succeeded
 *   2. the fallback log line was emitted (proves the swap happened)
